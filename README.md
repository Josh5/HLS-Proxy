HLS Proxy - originally designed for use with [TVH-IPTV-Config](https://github.com/Josh5/TVH-IPTV-Config) as a playlist proxy.


## Using the proxy

| ENABLE_DEBUGGING | Enables debug logging. Default `false`. |
| HLS_PROXY_PREFIX | The proxy URL prefix string. The default is `proxy` which will produce the proxy URL `http://<host>:<PORT>/proxy.m3u8?url=<UPSTREAM_PLAYLIST_URL>`. |
